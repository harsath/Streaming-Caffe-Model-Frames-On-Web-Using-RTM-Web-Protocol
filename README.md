### üßµ Here are using Threads for Multiple clients requesting the IP
#### Simultaneous execution of two or more parts of a program to maximum utilize the CPU time. A multithreaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently for reducing serverside latency
### ‚ùìHow to run?
> $python3 streamer_web_MAIN.py --prototxt deploy.prototxt.txt --model mobilenet.caffemodel --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 86330
#### üìù I post this Code to Help people who are looking to Stream their DL Model's Output into a Web Protocol by showing them a Simple example so do what ever you want with my code.
